This directory holds end to end tests, written usually in a combination of
shell and some Python 3.

They're not expected to be portable, as that gets impractical very quickly.
They also have some dependencies, listed below.


## Dependencies

The tests depend on the following things being installed on the system (listed
as Debian package, for consistency):

 - msmtp
 - util-linux (for /usr/bin/setsid)

For t-02-exim (Exim interaction tests):
 - gettext-base (for /usr/bin/envsubst)
 - The exim binary available somewhere, but it doesn't have to be installed.
   There's a script "get-exim4-debian.sh" to get it from the archives.

For some tests, python >= 3.5 is required; they will be skipped if it's not
available.
