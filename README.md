## Status

chasquid is in beta.

It's functional and has had some production exposure, but some things may
still change in backwards-incompatible way, including the configuration format.
It should be rare and will be avoided if possible.

You can subscribe to the mailing list to get notifications of such changes,
which are also documented in the [UPGRADING](UPGRADING.md) file.


## Documentation

The [Debian+Dovecot+chasquid how-to](docs/howto.md) and the
[installation guide](INSTALL.md)
are the best starting points on how to install, configure and run chasquid.
